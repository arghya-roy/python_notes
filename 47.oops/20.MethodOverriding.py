# Method Overriding
'''In this example, we have a vehicle class as a parent and a ‘Car’ and ‘Truck’ as its sub-class. 
But each vehicle can have a different seating capacity, speed, etc., so we can have the same instance method name in each 
class but with a different implementation. Using this code can be extended and easily maintained over time.
