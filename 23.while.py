'''
A “for” statement loop runs until the iteration through, set, lists, tuple, etc., 
or a generator function is completed. In the case of a while loop, the statement simply loops 
until the condition we have provided becomes false. We generally use for loops for areas where we are 
already familiar with the number of iterations and use while loop where the number of iterations are unknown. 
Because while the loop is solely based on the state of its condition.
