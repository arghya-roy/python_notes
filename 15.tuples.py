Tuples in Python:
A tuple is an immutable data type in Python. A tuple in python is a collection of elements enclosed in () (parentheses). 
Tuple, once defined, can’t be changed, i.e., its elements or values can’t be altered or manipulated.
'''

 # Tuples in Python :
a=()    # It's an example of empty tuple
x=(1,)   # Tuple with single value i.e. 1 
tup1 = (1,2,3,4,5)
tup1 = ('harry', 5, 'demo', 5.8)

'''
Note: To create a tuple of one element, it is necessary to put a comma  ‘,’ 
after that one element like this tup=(1,) because if we have only 1 element inside the parenthesis, 
the python interpreter will interpret it as a single entity which is why it’s important to use a ‘,’ 
after the element while creating tuples of a single element.
