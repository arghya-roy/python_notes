# Operator Overloading in Python -
'''
Operator overloading means changing the default behavior of an operator depending on the operands (values) that we use. 
In other words, we can use the same operator for multiple purposes.

For example, the + operator will perform an arithmetic addition operation when used with numbers. Likewise, 
it will perform concatenation when used with strings.

The operator + is used to carry out different operations for distinct data types. 
This is one of the most simple occurrences of polymorphism in Python.

# add 2 numbers
print(100 + 200)

# concatenate two strings
print('Jess' + 'Roy')

# merger two list
print([10, 20, 30] + ['jessa', 'emma', 'kelly'])
